### Compiled .ko files live here

You should make sure to get the compiled file for your release version by way of the tags in this repo. The untagged master branch will have the most recent build, which may or may not be stable, or what you are looking for.

e.g. if you are running CoreOS release 835.9.0, get it explicitly:

https://github.com/waltermeyer/pfring-coreos/tree/835.9.0/builds/kernel/pf_ring.ko
